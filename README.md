```Data Visualization Using D3.JS``` is my final year project for my Computer Science degree taken at De Montfort University.


## APIs
> Instead of using the smaller dataset from Kaggle, I've looked at a few APIs that can automatically grab the data for the visualization. Below I have listed the APIs that have caught my interest with the last link being the chosen API for the project.
